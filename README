This is an implementation of the OVSDB protocol in OCaml. OVSDB is a JSON-RPC protocol used to configure the Open vSwitch (http://openvswitch.org). The protocol can remotely create, modify, and remove switches, add and configure switch ports, etc.

This project requires rpc-light (https://github.com/samoht/rpc-light).

WARNING: Work in progress! The current revision is still experimental and incomplete.
